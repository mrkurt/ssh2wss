# Test Status Report

## Terminal Tests

### Character Handling
- ✅ TestCharacterAttributes: All sub-tests passing
- ✅ TestCombinedAttributes: All sub-tests passing
- ❌ TestCharacterSets: Multiple failures
  - ASCII_Set
  - Special_Characters
  - Control_Characters
  - Mixed_Content
- ❌ TestControlCharacterHandling: All sub-tests failing
- ❌ TestExtendedCharacters: Box_Drawing failing, others passing

### Display and Color
- ✅ TestColorOutput: All sub-tests passing

### Cursor and Line Operations
- ❌ TestCursorMovement: Both sub-tests failing
- ❌ TestLineWrapping: Wrapping_Disabled failing
- ❌ TestBackspaceHandling: Both sub-tests failing
- ❌ TestCursorOperations: All sub-tests failing
- ❌ TestCursorWrapping: Both sub-tests failing
- ❌ TestLineOperations: All sub-tests failing

## Known Issues

1. Character Set Support
   - Special character handling not properly implemented
   - Control character processing needs improvement
   - Box drawing characters not rendering correctly

2. Cursor Operations
   - Basic cursor movement not working
   - Line wrapping behavior incorrect
   - Backspace handling needs fixing

3. Terminal Operations
   - Line operations not functioning
   - Cursor wrapping issues
   - Screen buffer management problems

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper character set support
   - Add UTF-8 encoding handling
   - Implement control character processing
   - Fix box drawing character support

2. Fix cursor operations
   - Implement proper cursor movement
   - Add line wrapping support
   - Fix backspace handling

3. Improve terminal operations
   - Add proper line operation support
   - Fix cursor wrapping
   - Implement screen buffer management

## Notes

- Basic terminal attributes and color support are working correctly
- Major issues are in character set handling and cursor operations
- Need to focus on implementing proper terminal emulation features
