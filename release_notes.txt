ssh2wss: WebSocket to SSH bridge for proxied connections

Implements a bridge that tunnels SSH connections through WebSocket proxies,
allowing SSH access in environments where direct connections are blocked.

ssh: core functionality
- tunnels SSH traffic through WebSocket proxies
- maintains end-to-end encryption
- handles connection multiplexing

auth: key-based authentication
- uses standard OpenSSH key formats
- supports multiple auth methods
- handles key rotation

pty: terminal handling
- full pseudo-terminal support
- window size management
- ANSI/color support
- interactive command execution

client: OpenSSH compatibility
- works with standard SSH clients
- no client modifications needed
- native SSH experience

proxy: built-in support
- automatic proxy detection
- proxy auth handling
- configurable settings

Implementation uses Go's stdlib crypto/ssh package for SSH protocol handling,
providing native support for SSH key formats and cryptographic operations.

Architecture:
1. SSH server - auth and terminal sessions
2. WebSocket bridge - connection proxying
3. Auth system - key management

This release enables SSH access through WebSocket proxies in restricted networks.
